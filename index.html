    <h1>Dogoo is an app for dog owners</h1>
    <h2>Presentation by Magdalena Piekarska_Web Technologies_Victoria University</h2>
    <p>People will be able to find dog friendly beaches, Parks, Restaurants and other dog activities all year round.
        The main issue is that usualy it is really hard to find where to go with your dog and let it of the leash. The app should solve this problem. At the start it will be a website to later develop to a fully functional app.
