    <h1><strong>Dogoo THIS IS A WEBSITE FOR DOG OWNERS</strong></h1>
    <h2><b>Presentation by Magdalena Piekarska_Web Technologies_Victoria University</b></h2>
    <p>People will be able to find dog friendly beaches, Parks, Restaurants and other dog activities all year round.
        The main issue is that usualy it is really hard to find where to go with your dog and let it of the leash. The app should solve this problem. At the start it will be a website to later develop to a fully functional app.
 </p>
 
 <p>Here is a quote from WWF's website:</p> <blockquote cite="http://www.worldwildlife.org/who/index.html">
For 50 years, WWF has been protecting the future of nature.
The world's leading conservation organization,
WWF works in 100 countries and is supported by
1.2 million members in the United States and
close to 5 million globally.
